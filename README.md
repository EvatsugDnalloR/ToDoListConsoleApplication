# ToDoListConsoleApplication
A robust C++ application functioned as a ToDo List application with console user-interface. This project serces as a practical exercise for me to implement part of the basic C++ features that i have learned.

## Overview
- Add, delete, modify, and mark ToDo items as done
- Save and load ToDo items from a specification file
- Unit tests for all testable methods in every class

## Future plan for further feature
- [ ] Prettier console UI.
- [ ] Make the program to be able to choose to save the specification.txt file or not.
- [ ] UndoRedo feature (probably through Command design pattern)
- [ ] ... (more to be added)
